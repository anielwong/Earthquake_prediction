# Earthquake Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the Earthquake Project ! This project is focused on the Earthquake time prediction. It is based on the [Kaggle Competition LANL Earthquake Prediction](http://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction) launched on Jan 10, 2019. Please visit the webpage for further information. 

AWS Sagemaker was uses during the implementation of the codes.

The purpose of this project was to get hands on Kaggle competitions and AWS Sagemaker. **The best results weren’t the main focus of this project.**
